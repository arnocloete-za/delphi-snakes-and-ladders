# delphi-snakes-and-ladders<br>
Snakes and Ladders with Delphi code. <br>
I did not want to commit the full project, because this is part of the school curriculum for Grade 11 and Grade 12s in South Africa.<br>
But you are welcome to use the code to get a good start if you are struggling. If you need assistance, you are welcome to contact me.<br>
